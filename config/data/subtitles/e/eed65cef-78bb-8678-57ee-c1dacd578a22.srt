1
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,640
They were heard screaming at each
other for 2 hours. Nothing new.

2
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,870
Then they heard the gun go off.
Both barrels.

3
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,730
A crime of passion.

4
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,640
Yeah.

5
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,910
Just look at all the passion
on that wall.

6
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,640
This is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

7
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,580
Did the kid see it?

8
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,720
What?

9
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,350
The kid?

10
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,160
What kind of question's that?

11
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,660
We'll be real glad when we get rid of
you, Somerset. Always these questions.

12
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,430
"Did the kid see it?"
Who gives a fuck?

13
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,440
He's dead.
His wife killed him.

14
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,170
Anything else has nothing
to do with us.

15
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,480
Detective Somerset?

16
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm Detective Mills.

17
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,560
Just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

18
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,600
Look...

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,530
Mills?

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,470
- Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...
- I'd like to get to the precinct.

21
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,200
Not much time for
this transition thing.

22
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,540
I had a question,
when we spoke on the phone.

23
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah.

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,280
Why here?

25
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,640
I don't follow.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,480
Well, all this effort
to get transferred.

27
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,110
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

28
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,560
Same reason as you. Or the reason
you had before you decided to quit.

29
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,670
You just met me.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,170
Maybe I don't understand the question.

31
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,000
It's very simple.

32
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,410
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

33
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,840
- I never saw it done that way.
- Thought I'd do some good.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,350
It'd be great if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,420
- You're calling the shots.
- Yes.

36
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,360
I want you to look and
I want you to listen. Okay?

37
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,600
I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.
I've worked homicide 5 years.

38
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,360
- Not here.
- I understand.

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,870
Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,
do me the favor of remembering that.

40
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,550
SE7EN

41
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,220
MONDAY

42
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,130
MONDAY

43
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,100
Yeah.

44
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,660
Okay.

45
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,000
Say it again?

46
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,110
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

47
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,850
Serpico's got to go.

48
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,360
Well, you might want
to get rid of this little...

49
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,020
crusty, this eye, Serpico.

50
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,860
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

51
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,020
Good.

52
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,810
Coffee?

53
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,650
Nothing's been touched.
It's all like I found it.

54
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,490
What time was death established?

55
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,990
Like I said...

56
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,650
I didn't touch anything...

57
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,820
but he's had his face
in spaghetti for 45 minutes.

58
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,660
Wait. No one bothers
with vital signs?

59
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,610
Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing
unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.

60
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,940
- That's how it's done here?
- Excuse me, Detective.

61
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,850
He's sitting in his own piss and shit.
If he wasn't dead he would've stood up

62
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,270
- Alright.
- Thank you, Officer.

63
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,280
Thank you.

64
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,150
I wonder.

65
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,800
What was the point of the conversation
you were about to get into?

66
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,700
Don't know. How many times Barney Five
found dead bodies that weren't dead.

67
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,040
Drop it.

68
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,910
Somebody phone Guiness.
I think we've got a record here.

69
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,590
Better Homes and Gardens.

70
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,400
Spaghetti Sauce

71
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,170
Who said this was murder?

72
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,870
No one.

73
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,610
Guy's heart must be the size...

74
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,050
of a canned ham.

75
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,280
If this isn't a coronary...

76
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,450
well...

77
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,560
I don't know.

78
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,970
Whoops.

79
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,990
How about that.

80
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,060
We had this case once...

81
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,990
guy dead on the ground...

82
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,900
knife in his back.
Murder...

83
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,270
right?

84
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,440
Fuck!

85
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,670
Anyway, big insurance policy involved,
yeah? So the guy...

86
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,240
took the tip of the blade...

87
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,720
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

88
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,810
He must've screwed up
'cause there was...

89
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,720
- multiples back there.
- Please be quiet.

90
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,230
Wait a minute.

91
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,330
What?

92
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,670
Got a bucket here.

93
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,870
What's in it?

94
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,910
Oh God!

95
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,580
Fucking vomit.

96
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,220
Any blood in it?

97
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,190
I didn't see any.
Help yourself.

98
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,430
Are you thinking it's poison?

99
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,190
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

100
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,930
Think it's poison, Somerset?

101
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,100
You girls have got forensics
waiting outside.

102
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,700
We might not fit.

103
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,270
There's room. Light's the problem.

104
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,640
How are you?

105
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,940
Det. Mills, go help the officers...

106
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,540
question the neighbors.

107
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,450
What?

108
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,250
And send in forensics.

109
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,310
He's dead.

110
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,240
Thank you, Doctor.

111
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,820
You saw my files,
the things I've done?

112
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,140
Nope.

113
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,420
I did door-to-doors and walked
the beat. I did that shit...

114
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,590
a long time.

115
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,490
- And?
- My badge says...

116
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,470
"detective".
That's the same as yours.

117
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,830
Look, I made a decision.

118
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,270
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene...

119
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,940
not whether you were getting
enough time on the field.

120
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,110
Hey, man...

121
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,510
Just don't jerk me off. That's all
I ask. Don't jerk me off.

122
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,290
He's been dead...

123
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,020
a long time, and not from poison.

124
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,530
Oh, man.

125
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,690
How can you let yourself go like that?

126
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,140
It took 4 orderlies just
to get him on the table.

127
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,050
- How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?
- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.

128
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,210
Look. See how big this stomach is?

129
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,150
And the strange thing is,
it stretches.

130
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,380
Look at the size of the
cardiac orifice, where the food...

131
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,220
I see that, but it means
nothing to me.

132
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,820
Okay, he's got lines of distention...

133
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,490
across the duodenum.

134
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,190
The interior wall's ripped open.

135
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,320
This man ate till he burst?

136
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,340
He didn't really burst. Not all the
way. He was hemorrhaging internally.

137
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,240
There was a hematoma
in the rectus and...

138
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,510
- the transverse abdominous muscles.
- He did die by eating?

139
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,740
Yes and no.

140
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,810
What about these bruises here?

141
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,580
I haven't figured that out yet.

142
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,590
Gun pressed against his head?

143
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,090
Pressed hard enough.

144
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,350
Fuck, yeah.

145
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,360
On the front, flush with the muzzle.

146
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,940
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

147
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,370
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving. Took his time too.

148
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,380
Coroner said it could have lasted
more than 12 hours.

149
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,780
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort...

150
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,720
and there was a point
when he passed out.

151
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,950
That's when the killer kicked him...

152
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,960
- and he burst.
- Sadistic fucker.

153
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,290
When you want somebody dead,
you drive by and shoot.

154
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,230
You don't risk the time
it takes to do this...

155
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,230
- unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

156
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,100
Somebody had a problem with a fat boy
and tortured him. Simple as that.

157
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,430
In the grocery bags...

158
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,030
we found 2 receipts. So,
the killer stopped and went back...

159
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,630
to the supermarket.

160
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,540
So?

161
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,420
Man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

162
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,480
- This is beginning.
- We've got...

163
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,420
one dead guy, not three.

164
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,650
No motive.

165
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,250
Don't start that big brain of yours...

166
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,920
cooking on this, alright?

167
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,330
I'd like to be reassigned.

168
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,660
Whoa.

169
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you talking about?

170
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,000
This can't be my last duty.

171
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,730
It'll go on and on.

172
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,840
You're retiring in 6 days.

173
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,940
You've left unfinished
business before.

174
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,010
Those cases were taken as close
to conclusion as possible.

175
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,290
- And if I may speak freely?
- We're friends here.

176
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,120
It's his first assignment.

177
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,180
I knew it. This is not
my first assignment, you dick.

178
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,450
It's too soon.

179
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,860
I'm here. You can say that
shit to my face. Captain?

180
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,130
It's too soon for you.

181
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,190
Captain...

182
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,360
Can we talk in private?

183
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,870
This is a personal thing--

184
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,710
Just shut up, Mills.

185
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,640
I don't have anyone else...

186
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,040
to put on this and you know it.
This is Metro...

187
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,010
- you don't just get to swap.
- Give it to me.

188
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,650
He wants out, fuck him.
See you, have a nice time.

189
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,980
Give it to me.

190
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,020
I'll put you on something else.

191
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,860
Go on, Mills, just go on.

192
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,170
I'm sorry, old buddy,
but it looks like you're stuck...

193
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
cleaning up the fat man.

194
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,450
TUESDAY

195
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,610
TUESDAY

196
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,320
MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!

197
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,220
ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED

198
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,820
Quiet down.

199
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,160
Alright, calm down. Calm down.

200
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,220
Quiet down.

201
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,340
Here's how it'll work:

202
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,500
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

203
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,910
Ask those questions in a calm, sane,
orderly fashion or I will leave.

204
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,850
Detective? Detective?

205
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,850
- Can I have a moment?
- No.

206
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,750
I won't discuss the details of this
investigation, so don't bother asking.

207
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,610
What you got for me?

208
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,210
Nothing yet, boss.

209
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,680
Why don't you guys go get
a coffee, huh?

210
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,390
We have this breaking story.
Let's go downtown where attorney...

211
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,060
Eli Gould was found murdered today.

212
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,570
District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.

213
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,070
That's ridiculous and offensive.

214
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,980
There is no conflict, and any claim
there could be is irresponsible.

215
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,580
Now hold on.

216
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,990
I just met with law enforcement
officials and they...

217
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,290
assured me that they have their
very best men on this.

218
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,320
This will be the very definition...

219
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,100
of swift justice.

220
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,340
GREED

221
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,450
Pardon me, George.

222
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,950
Somerset.

223
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,190
Come in.

224
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,970
You heard the news?

225
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,470
Nope, haven't heard.

226
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,370
Eli Gould was found
murdered this morning.

227
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,880
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

228
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,970
Wrote the word "greed"
on the floor.

229
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,580
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

230
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,020
Mills is heading the investigation.

231
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,590
Excuse me. Excuse me.

232
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,060
Don't do that, please?

233
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,130
Good for him.

234
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,630
What will you do...

235
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,800
with yourself out there, Somerset?

236
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,140
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
Fix my house.

237
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,640
Don't you feel it?

238
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,910
Don't you feel that feeling?

239
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,310
You're not going to be a cop anymore.

240
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,150
That's the whole idea.

241
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,320
I don't think you'll leave.

242
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,250
Hell, you can't leave all this.

243
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,650
Guy's out walking his dog.

244
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,250
Gets attacked.

245
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,260
His watch is taken, his wallet.

246
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,660
And while he's lying...

247
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,330
on the sidewalk helpless...

248
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,830
his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

249
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,210
This happened last night
about 4 blocks from here.

250
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,140
I read about it.

251
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,980
I don't understand anymore.

252
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,250
It's the way it's always been.

253
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,190
- Maybe you're right.
- This work is what you're made for.

254
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,350
I don't think you can deny that.

255
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,020
Maybe I'm wrong.

256
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,590
The coroner sent this down for you.

257
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,700
Found them in
the fat boy's stomach...

258
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,540
mixed in with the food.
Looks like little pieces of...

259
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,370
- plastic.
- Set them on that desk.

260
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,200
They were...

261
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,510
fed to him.

262
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,040
Lord.

263
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,880
GLUTTONY

264
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,830
This was found behind the refrigerator
in the obesity murder scene.

265
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,830
"Long is the way

266
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,160
And hard, that out of hell
leads up to light."

267
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,500
It's from Milton.

268
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,670
"Paradise Lost."

269
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,230
Alright...

270
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm confused.

271
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,010
It means that this is beginning.

272
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,340
GLUTTONY

273
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,510
This was behind
the same refrigerator...

274
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,910
written in grease.

275
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,080
There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.

276
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,910
Gluttony...

277
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,580
greed...

278
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,190
sloth, wrath...

279
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,390
pride, lust...

280
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,190
and envy.

281
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,760
Seven.

282
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,770
Hold on.

283
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,670
This is not even my desk.

284
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,840
You can expect five more of these.

285
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,670
Wait a minute.

286
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,110
I can't get involved in this.

287
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,550
Somerset.

288
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,380
He wanted it.

289
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,220
Damn!

290
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm all over it.

291
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,260
Where to?

292
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,430
Far away from here.

293
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,000
- Just a few things to look up.
- Okay.

294
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,780
Sit where you'd like.

295
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,880
How's everybody?

296
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,440
Hiya, Smiley.

297
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,380
George, the cards are getting cold.

298
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,290
Duty calls.

299
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,870
Gentlemen? Gentlemen...

300
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,080
I'll never understand.

301
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,140
All these books...

302
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,650
a world of knowledge right here...

303
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,880
and what do you do?

304
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,210
You play poker all night.

305
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,660
Hey, we got culture.

306
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,320
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

307
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,560
How's this for culture?

308
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,390

Dante's Purgatory
The Canterbury Tales

313
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,880
was crimson with his blood:

314
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,000
Even children slain!

315
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,920
You know, Smiley...

316
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,700
you'll really miss us.

317
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,930
I just might.

WEDNESDAY

322
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,420
Fucking Dante.

323
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,050
Goddamn poetry-writing fatggot
piece of shit.

324
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,660
Fucker.

325
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,330
Good work, Officer.

326
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,120
Thank you, Lord.

327
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,620
Oh, oh, sorry.

328
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,030
I'll move in a second.

329
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,140
- You want your chair?
- You go ahead.

330
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,050
Yeah?

331
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,720
Phone.

332
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,360
Package deal.
Comes with the office.

333
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,520
Mills.

334
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,430
Honey...

335
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,370
You okay? Something wrong?

336
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,240
You dingleberry, I told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

337
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,880
Yeah. Why?

338
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,950
Why?

339
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,950
Okay.

340
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,050
It's my wife.

341
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,590
Sorry?

342
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,520
She'd like to speak to you.

343
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,470
This is Detective Somerset.

344
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,240
Well, yes, it's nice
to talk to you too.

345
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,250
I appreciate the offer, but...

346
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,090
Well, in that case I'd be delighted.

347
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,990
Yes, thank you very much.

348
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,320
Bye.

349
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,330
Honey, what...?

350
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,780
Well?

351
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,140
Sorry?

352
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,850
I'm invited to late supper
at your apartment. I accepted.

353
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,750
At my... How's that?

354
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,350
Tonight.

355
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,360
Hello, men.

356
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,690
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

357
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,930
That's Tracy. Tracy...

358
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,800
Hello.

359
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,670
Glad to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

360
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,930
Except your first name.

361
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,540
It's William.

362
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,550
Well, it's a good name...

363
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,640
William.

364
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,550
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,560
- David, this is William.
- Alright, I'll be right back.

366
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,820
- How are the kids?
- Good. They're in the room. Come in.

367
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,390
Aw, good dogs.

368
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,400
How are all the good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

369
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,010
Smells good.

370
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,350
Yeah, I mean, thank you.

371
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,350
Please have a seat, if you like.

372
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,420
- Would you like a drink?
- No. Thanks. I'll wait.

373
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,360
Throw that anywhere.
Excuse all this mess.

374
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,090
We're still unpacking.

375
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,260
I hear you were
high school sweethearts.

376
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,260
Pretty hokey, huh?

377
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,940
You know something?

378
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,040
On our first date I knew he was...

379
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,600
- the guy I'd marry.
- Really?

380
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,450
He was the funniest guy I ever met.

381
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,350
Really.

382
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,900
It's kind of rare nowadays.

383
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,230
I mean, that level of...

384
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,390
commitment.

385
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,640
Oh, don't worry.

386
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,470
I won't wear it to the dinner table.

387
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,410
No matter...

388
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,140
how often I see guns,
I just can't...

389
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,650
get used to them.

390
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,950
Same here.

391
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,930
- Why aren't you married, William?
- Tracy.

392
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,260
What the hell?

393
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,030
I was close once.

394
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,370
It just didn't happen.

395
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,370
It surprises me.

396
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,530
It really does.

397
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,970
Well...

398
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,610
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

399
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,950
Just ask your husband.

400
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,110
Very true.

401
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,290
Very, very true.

402
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,120
How long have you lived here?

403
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,050
Too long.

404
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,360
How do you like it?

405
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,460
You know...

406
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,300
takes time. Settle in...

407
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,030
it'll be good.

408
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,240
Well, you get numb after awhile

409
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,650
There are things to any city...

410
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,580
Subway.

411
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,080
It'll go away in a minute.

412
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,490
This real estate guy.

413
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,760
Fucking piece of...
Sorry, honey.

414
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,930
He shows us the place a few times,
I think he's good.

415
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,670
He's efficient.
Tracy really likes him.

416
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,440
Then I start wondering why he'll only
bring us here 5 minutes at a time.

417
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,410
We found out the first night.

418
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,180
The soothing, relaxing...

419
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,510
vibrating home, huh?

420
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,360
I'm sorry.

421
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,470
Yeah, alright, laugh it up.

422
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,610
I don't know why you're laughing.

423
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,140
Alright, already.

424
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,380
He had to get into the building...

425
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,480
before the office closed.
Gould would have been working late?

426
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,790
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

427
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,230
- Infamous, really.
- Body was found on Tuesday morning.

428
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,740
The office was closed on Monday.
So he could have gotten in on Friday.

429
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,860
Laid low till the cleaning crew left,
then had...

430
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,400
his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,
maybe Monday.

431
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,740
Look.

432
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,610
Gould was bound, right arm free.

433
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,840
He was handed a butcher's knife.

434
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,720
Check out the scale.

435
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,050
A pound of flesh.

436
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,260
"One pound of flesh"

437
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,820
"No more no less
No cartilage...

438
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,090
No bone....

439
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,530
only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."

440
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,940
Didn't see it.

441
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,070
"This task done...
And he would Go Free".

442
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,270
I tell you that chair was...

443
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,040
- soaked through with sweat.
- Of course.

444
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,450
The killer wanted Gould
to take his time...

445
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,940
deciding which cut....

446
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,210
to make first.

447
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,220
Imagine it.

448
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,120
There's a gun in your face.

449
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,090
Which part of your body
is expendable?

450
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,460
The love handle.

451
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,560
Cut along the side
of his own stomach.

452
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,270
Let's take a fresh look at these.
The corpse is there, but...

453
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,800
Iook through it.
Edit out your initial shock.

454
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,900
The trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

455
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,410
until it's an exhausted possibility.

456
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,450
I'll get another beer. Beer?

457
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Wine, please.

458
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,590
He's preaching.

459
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,490
Punishing.

460
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,490
The sins were used
in medieval sermons.

461
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,460
7 cardinal virtues,
7 deadly sins...

462
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,810
- used as teaching tools.
- Yeah. Like in...

463
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,570
- "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.
- You read them?

464
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,770
Yeah.

465
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,320
Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...

466
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,880
Dante and his buddy climb up the hill
and check out all the sinners?

467
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,720
- The Seven Terraces of Purgation.
- Yeah, right.

468
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,160
But there pride comes first,
not gluttony.

469
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,720
For now let's consider...

470
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,790
the books as the killer's inspiration.

471
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,840
The sermons were about atonement
for sin.

472
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,340
These murders are like
forced attrition.

473
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,900
Forced what?

474
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,170
Attrition's when you regret your sins,
but not because...

475
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,150
- you love God.
- Because there's a gun in your face.

476
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,180
No fingerprints.

477
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,690
Nope.

478
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,850
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yep.

479
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,690
And no witnesses of any kind.

480
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,420
Which I don't get...

481
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,430
because the fucker
had to get back out.

482
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,600
In any major city, minding
your own business is a science.

483
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,900
In rape prevention, the first thing
they teach you is never cry for help.

484
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,370
Always yell, "Fire!".

485
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,880
Nobody answers help.

486
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,970
Holler "fire," they'll come.

487
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,780
That's fucked up.

488
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,620
He must have left
another puzzle piece.

489
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,960
You know what? Thank you for talking
this out, but I must sleep.

490
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,620
Walk the dogs.

491
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,220
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.

492
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,290
- I'm leaving at the end of the week.
- Shit. No, wait.

493
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,900
Gould's wife. She was out of town
at the time.

494
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,310
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

495
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,410
I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

496
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,920
What if it isn't what she has seen...

497
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:31,220
but what she's supposed to see
but hasn't had the chance?

498
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,090
Yeah, okay. What?

499
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,660
I don't know.

500
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,440
But that's the one thing.

501
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,210
I'll sign us in.

502
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,210
Must see Mrs. Gould.

503
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,330
Mrs. Gould?

504
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,030
Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.
I truly am.

505
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,540
I don't understand.

506
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:49,600
I need you to look at each photo...

507
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,740
very carefully.

508
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,410
Look and see if there's anything
strange or...

509
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,080
out of place, anything at all.

510
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,350
I don't see anything.

511
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,920
Please, I can't do this right now.

512
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,080
Okay.

513
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,750
It's got to be now.

514
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,760
There may be something we missed.

515
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,530
Wait.

516
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:21,580
What?

517
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,700
Here.

518
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,270
This painting, it's upside down.

519
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,120
- Your men didn't move this?
- No.

520
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,560
Those shots were taken
before forensics.

521
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,120
Nothing.

522
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,390
There's got to be something.

523
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,980
- He moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

524
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,910
What the fuck is that?

525
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,820
Switchblade.

526
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,760
Goddamn it.

527
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,510
There must be something.

528
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,770
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

529
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,660
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

530
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,090
See this, this is us.

531
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,530
Just wait a minute.

532
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,640
- Somerset's climbing on the furniture.
- Wait a minute.

533
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,080
You're kidding me.

534
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,140
Call the print lab.

535
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,720
Oh, man.

536
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,660
Honestly...

537
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,320
have you ever seen anything like this?

538
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,090
HELP ME

539
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,110
The swell pattern tells me
that they're not...

540
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,440
the victim's fingerprints.

541
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,690
I don't know, man.

542
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,880
I say he's whacked enough.

543
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,820
It doesn't fit.

544
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,290
He doesn't want to stop.

545
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,450
Who knows.

546
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,690
Freaks out there doing their
evil deeds they don't want to do.

547
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,290
"The voices made me do it".

548
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,300
"Jodie Foster made me do it".

549
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:04,840
It can take...

550
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,000
3 days to make a match,
so maybe you guys want to cross...

551
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,810
your fingers somewhere else.

552
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,320
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

553
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,150
About catching this guy.

554
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,250
Wish I still thought
the way you did.

555
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,100
Tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing?

556
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,870
Picking up the pieces.

557
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:39,270
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples...

558
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,440
writing everything down...

559
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,840
noting the time things happened.

560
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,270
That's all?

561
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,440
That's all.

562
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,290
Putting everything into neat piles
and filing it away...

563
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,350
on the off chance it'll be needed
in the courtroom.

564
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,290
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island...

565
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,530
saving them in case we get rescued.

566
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,630
Bullshit.

567
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,180
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

568
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,980
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

569
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,550
Don't try to tell me you didn't
get that rush tonight.

570
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,160
I saw you.

571
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:33,050
We're getting somewhere.

572
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:43,240
THURSDAY

573
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,800
THURSDAY

574
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,240
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

575
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,170
We got a winner.

576
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:02,160
He uses the name Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

577
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,850
Homicide found his prints
at the scene.

578
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,590
He's got a long history
of serious mental illnesses.

579
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,330
He got a very strict
Southern Baptist upbringing.

580
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,860
Somewhere along the line
they fell short.

581
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,430
Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery
and assault, spent time...

582
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,710
in prison for the attempted rape
of a minor.

583
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:25,610
His lawyer made sure that didn't
last long. By the way...

584
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,450
the lawyer was Eli Gould,
the "greed" victim.

585
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,220
We'll stop this today,
ladies and germs.

586
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:35,780
Victor's been out of circulation for
awhile, but we've a residence for him.

587
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,390
- You're not buying this?
- Doesn't seem...

588
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,060
Iike our guy, does it?

589
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,190
You tell me.

590
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,530
Our killer seems to have
more purpose.

591
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,890
You ever take a bullet?

592
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:18,100
Never in my thirty-four years,
knock on wood.

593
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,500
I've only taken my gun out...

594
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:24,100
3 times wanting to use it.

595
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,840
Never pulled the trigger.

596
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,110
Not once.

597
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,480
You?

598
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,850
Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,
but...

599
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,510
I pulled my gun once.
Shot it once.

600
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,680
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

601
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,950
We were a secondary unit.

602
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,860
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie.

603
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,030
We bust open the door looking for this
junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.

604
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,200
One cop got hit in the arm.

605
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,970
Christ, what was his name?

606
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,040
It spun him like a top... no, Well,
more, you know, more like slow motion.

607
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:04,040
I remember...

608
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,310
riding in that ambulance...

609
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,720
and, well...

610
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,220
he died right there.

611
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,820
Right there.

612
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:14,960
Christ, what was his fucking name?

613
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,400
SWAT goes before dicks.

614
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:40,640
They love this.

615
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,610
Police!

616
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,810
Clear!

617
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,950
Good morning, sweetheart.

618
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,010
Get up now, motherfucker. Now!

619
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,030
Get up, you sack of shit.

620
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,100
Oh, fuck me.

621
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:39,640
Dicks!

622
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,470
You'll want to come
take a look at this.

623
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,970
Dicks!

624
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,550
Jesus.

625
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,820
Victor?

626
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,330
- What the hell?
- It's just Victor.

627
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,060
- Call an ambulance.
- What the fuck?

628
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,490
Hearse, I'd say.

629
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,050
Call for forensics.

630
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,720
Get your people out.

631
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,560
No one touches anything.

632
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,970
It's like a frigging wax sculpture.

633
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,240
Sloth.

634
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,180
Aw, man.

635
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,520
Goddamn.

636
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,360
Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.

637
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,190
This must be the first.

638
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,130
Look.

639
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,430
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

640
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,210
I got a hair sample. I got a...

641
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,540
stool sample. I got piss. I got...

642
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,940
fingernails.

643
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,680
He's laughing at us.

644
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,050
You got what you deserved.

645
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,390
He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!

646
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:05,790
Guns down!

647
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,130
Guns down!
Emergency on that ambulance!

648
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,880
- He's playing games.
- Aw, no shit.

649
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,750
We must forget our emotion.

650
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,820
- We must focus on the details
- I feed off my emotions. How's that?

651
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,330
Are you listening to me?

652
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,890
Yes, I can hear you.

653
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,660
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

654
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,500
- Closed crime scene. Leave.
- I got a right to be here.

655
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:46,930
I'm a U.P.I. photographer.

656
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,960
I got a fucking right to be here.

657
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,870
- Get out! Jesus.
- Fucking jerk.

658
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,880
I got your picture, man.

659
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,210
- I got your picture.
- Yeah, yeah.

660
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,150
Detective Mills.
M-l-L-L-S. Fuck off.

661
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,980
- You can spell!
- Fuck you!

662
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,220
How they get here so fucking quick?

663
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,880
They pay police for the information.
And they pay well.

664
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,550
Hey man, I'm sorry.

665
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,060
They piss me off.

666
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,390
It's okay.

667
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,090
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

668
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:30,280
1 year of immobility's right, judging
by the muscle and spine deterioration.

669
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:34,010
Blood tests show a smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

670
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,950
Even an antibiotic, probably to keep
the bed sores from infecting.

671
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:43,690
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

672
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,630
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

673
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,190
he chewed off his tongue long ago.

674
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,630
Doc.

675
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:56,860
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

676
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:02,370
He'd die of shock right now if you
shone a flashlight in his eyes.

677
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:08,050
He's had as much pain and suffering as
anyone I've encountered, give or take

678
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,710
and he still has hell
to look forward to.

679
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,390
Good night.

680
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,070
Hello, William.

681
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,730
It's Tracy.

682
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,370
Tracy?

683
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,070
Everything okay?

684
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,350
Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.

685
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,540
Where's David?

686
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,910
He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.

687
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:44,010
I'm sorry to call you like this.

688
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,580
Oh, it's all right.

689
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:48,060
What can I do for you?

690
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,690
I need someone to talk...

691
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,700
to. Do you think you could meet me...

692
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,070
somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?

693
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,600
I don't understand.

694
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,710
I feel stupid calling, but...

695
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,110
you're the only person
that I know here.

696
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,080
There's no one else.

697
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,040
If you can...

698
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,610
just give me a call, okay?

699
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,390
I have to go now.

700
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,290
Good night.

701
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,390
Good night.

702
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:28,200
FRIDAY

703
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,790
FRIDAY

704
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,000
I mean...

705
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,670
you know this city so well.

706
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,010
You've been here...

707
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,600
so long.

708
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,940
It can be a hard place.

709
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,080
I don't know why I asked you to come.

710
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,810
Why don't you talk to him about it?

711
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,920
Tell him how you feel.

712
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,090
I can't. You know,
I can't be a burden.

713
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,930
Especially now.

714
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,990
I'll get used to things...

715
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:04,260
you know?

716
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,500
I wanted to talk to someone...

717
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,270
who's lived here for a long time.

718
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:14,810
I mean, upstate, it's
a completely different environment.

719
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:23,250
Did David tell you that I teach
fifth grade? Well, I did.

720
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,790
Yeah, he mentioned it.

721
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:33,020
I've been going around,
looking at schools...

722
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,360
but the conditions here are...

723
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,200
horrible.

724
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,700
What about private schools?

725
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,140
I don't know.

726
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:50,610
Tell me what's really bothering you.

727
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:55,820
David and I are going to have a baby.

728
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,050
Oh, Tracy. I...

729
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,160
I don't think I'm the one...

730
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,160
to talk to...

731
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,000
- about this.
- I hate this city.

732
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,330
I had a relationship once...

733
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,240
it was very much like a marriage.

734
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,740
We got pregnant.

735
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,150
This was a long time ago.

736
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,920
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

737
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,440
Just a day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew...

738
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,040
about the pregnancy.

739
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,370
And I felt this fear...

740
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,770
the first time ever.

741
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,710
I remember thinking...

742
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,780
how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

743
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,790
How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

744
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,800
I told her I didn't want to have it.

745
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,940
And over the next few weeks...

746
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,800
I wore her down.

747
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,580
I want to have children.

748
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,240
I can tell you now that...

749
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:33,480
I know... I mean...

750
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,320
I'm positive that...

751
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,090
I made the right decision.

752
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,320
But not a day passes
that I don't wish...

753
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,090
that I had made a different choice.

754
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,170
If you don't...

755
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,330
keep...

756
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,840
the baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

757
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,510
don't ever tell him you were pregnant.

758
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,180
but if you choose to have the baby...

759
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,350
then spoil that kid...

760
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,190
every chance you get.

761
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,160
That's...

762
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,360
about...

763
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,800
all the advice I can give you, Tracy.

764
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,880
I must go.

765
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,140
William.

766
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,550
Thank you.

767
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:49,720
Gluttony Greed Sloth Envy
Wrath Pride Lust

768
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:58,490
Victor's landlord said there was cash
in the mail box...

769
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,230
the first of every month.

770
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,000
Quote:

771
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,370
"l never heard a single complaint
from the tenant...

772
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,070
in apartment 306, and nobody
ever complained about him.

773
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,240
The best tenant I've ever had."

774
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,680
- End quote.
- A landlord's dream.

775
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,720
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,450
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,260
I'm sick of this waiting.

778
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,480
This is the job.

779
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,420
Why aren't we out there?

780
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,090
Why must we sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic...

781
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,600
does it again?

782
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,760
"Lunatic" is dismissive.
Don't make that mistake.

783
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,530
Come on, he's insane. Look.

784
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:43,770
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

785
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,210
Yeah, rubbing himself
in peanut butter.

786
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,210
How's that?

787
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,610
I don't think so.

788
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,050
His luck'll run out.

789
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,050
He's not depending on luck.

790
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,390
We walked in there exactly 1 year
after he tied Victor to the bed.

791
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,230
One year to the day.

792
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,560
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

793
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:09,070
Oh, yes, we do.

794
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,900
This note he left...

795
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,240
his first words to us.

796
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,000
"Long is the way, and Hard,
that out of hell...

797
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,410
Ieads up to Light."

798
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,140
Fuck him. So what?

799
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,580
He's right, so far.

800
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,650
Imagine the will it takes to keep
a man bound for a full year.

801
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,160
To sever his hand and to use it...

802
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,750
to plant fingerprints.

803
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:35,730
To insert tubes into his genitals.

804
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,770
This guy's methodical, exacting...

805
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:41,100
and worst of all, patient.

806
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:43,100
He's a nutbag.

807
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:47,110
Because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

808
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,770
You got money?

809
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,180
I got 50. Fifty bucks.

810
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,680
I propose a field trip. Come on.

811
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,360
We'll make a list.
At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...

812
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:08,360
"Canterbury Tales," anything relating
to the 7 deadly sins.

813
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:09,860
- Ask yourself.
- Wait.

814
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,960
What would he study
to do the things he's done?

815
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:14,700
What are his interests now?

816
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,300
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

817
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:19,370
- Where are we going?
- Library.

818
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,490
Coupons. Coupons.
Free coupons. Discount--

819
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,050
Discount coupons.

820
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,660
They must have had about 50 health
violations during the last inspection.

821
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,830
Sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking...

822
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,030
we're dating.

823
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,160
Give me your money.

824
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,930
I'll give you this, but
I ought to know what are we doing.

825
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,510
Somerset. How you doing?

826
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,510
Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.

827
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:08,020
It's not a problem. Sit down.

828
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,530
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

829
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,830
- So we're in this fair and square.
- It's a deal.

830
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,540
About an hour.

831
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,540
Yep. Help yourself.

832
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,880
That was money well spent.

833
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,210
Yeah.

834
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,560
Alright.

835
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:50,400
Telling you this, I'm trusting you
more than I trust most people.

836
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,800
Good, 'cause I might punch you.

837
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:58,470
It's probably nothing, but even so,
it's no skin off our teeth.

838
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:04,540
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

839
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,640
Who, stinky man?

840
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:13,250
For years, the FBl's been hooked into
the library system, keeping records.

841
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,160
- Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

842
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,590
Look.

843
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,600
Certain books are flagged.

844
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,000
Books on, say, nuclear weapons...

845
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,090
"Mein Kampf".

846
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:30,440
Anyone who checks out a flagged book
has his library records fed to the FBl.

847
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:32,770
Wait. How is this legal?

848
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,640
Legal. Illegal.
These terms don't apply.

849
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:41,110
You can't use the information
directly. It's just a useful guide.

850
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:46,180
It might sound silly, but you can't
get a library card without an ID...

851
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,450
and a current phone bill. See?

852
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:52,160
- So they run our list.
- Precisely.

853
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,190
If you want to know who's reading...

854
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,790
"Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"
and "Helter Skelter"...

855
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,360
the FBl's computers will tell us.

856
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,960
It could give us a name.

857
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,130
Of a college kid writing
a term paper...

858
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,800
on 20th-century crime.

859
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,810
At least you're out of the office.

860
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,310
Get a haircut.

861
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,650
How do you know this?

862
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,550
I don't.

863
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,480
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

864
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,900
"Divine Comedy".

865
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:33,160
"History of Catholicism" A book
called "Murderers and Madmen".

866
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,730
"Modern Homicide lnvestigation".
"ln Cold Blood".

867
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:39,400
"Of Human Bondage". Bondage?

868
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,410
It's not what you think.

869
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:43,900
The Marquis de Sade.

870
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:46,180
- Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

871
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,840
Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...

872
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,010
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.

873
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,460
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

874
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:55,520
Is that it?

875
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:56,420
Yep.

876
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:59,800
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

877
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,630
Whatever.

878
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,430
We're sure about that name, are we?

879
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,870
You were, you saw it. John Doe.

880
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,360
You want to go back, I'll go back.

881
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,210
Let's take a look at him.
Talk to him.

882
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,540
This is crazy.

883
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:16,710
We'll just talk to him.

884
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,540
"Excuse me, sir. Do you
happen to be a serial killer?"

885
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,560
You do the talking.

886
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,220
Put that silver tongue of yours
to work.

887
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,960
You've talked to my wife?

888
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,230
Retarded.

889
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:38,630
Charlie's fucking Angels.

890
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,140
A name off a computer.

891
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,240
Mills.

892
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,920
- You hit?
- No.

893
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,000
He's going down!

894
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,100
Fifth floor!

895
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,700
Police. Is there a back way out?

896
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,530
Lock your door.

897
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,640
Get out of the fucking hall, please.

898
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:18,500
Get down!

899
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,110
Get the fuck down.

900
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,330
Goddamn it.

901
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,070
Get out of the fucking way. Clear.

902
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:46,940
Where are you going?

903
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:49,440
- I'm going in.
- No, no. Wait. Wait.

904
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:53,010
What? He fucking shot at us.

905
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,520
You can't go in.

906
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,450
- We need a warrant.
- We got probable cause. Come on.

907
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,350
Think about it. Think
how did we get here?

908
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,950
- I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.
- Get out of the way.

909
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:07,790
We have no reason to be here.
Would you listen to me?

910
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,630
- Get off, get the fuck off me.
- Alright, I'm sorry.

911
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,690
Just pay attention a minute?

912
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:17,640
With a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

913
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:20,540
The fucking guy'll walk.
That's what you want?

914
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:23,640
By the time we clear a warrant...
Fuck that.

915
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:27,310
We need a reason to knock on
this door.

916
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:29,890
Think about it.

917
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,550
Okay?

918
01:15:35,390 --> 01:15:36,480
Okay, okay.

919
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:39,990
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

920
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,830
When you're right, you're right.

921
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:50,770
Well...

922
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,670
no point in arguing anymore.

923
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,880
Unless you can fix that..

924
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,350
You stupid son of a ...

925
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,750
How much money we got left?

926
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,220
So, yeah, I noticed...

927
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,660
this guy going out a lot...

928
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,400
when the murders were happening,
so l...

929
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,900
So you called Det. Somerset?

930
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:25,030
- She called Somerset.
- 'Cause this guy...

931
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:28,040
was creepy and shit,
and one of the murders...

932
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,710
- happened right over there.
- I told you the rest.

933
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,040
Got everything?

934
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,110
Have her sign. You must sign.

935
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:37,180
Good.

936
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,620
You did good.

937
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,390
- I did what you said.
- Here.

938
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,450
You get something to eat.

939
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,960
Everybody stay outside.

940
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,790
Victor.

941
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,970
Wild Bill's Leather

942
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:46,570
Fuck.

943
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,590
LUST

944
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,130
Somerset!

945
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,610
- What?
- We had him.

946
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,010
What are you saying?

947
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,110
The fucking photographer in...

948
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,280
the fucking stairs.

949
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:31,180
We had him and we let him go.

950
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,800
You're sure this is him?

951
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,360
Yep. Good. Get it out.

952
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,470
No pay stubs. No appointment books.
No addresses. Just this receipt.

953
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,630
- Keep looking!
- Wait, look at this.

954
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,650
This was under the bed.
His only source of funds?

955
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:55,310
We got his money. I like it.

956
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,820
Wait. You won't believe this.

957
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:00,680
We haven't found a fingerprint.
Not one.

958
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,620
Right. I don't believe you.
Keep looking.

959
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,990
We could use some more men.

960
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:11,230
I'm doing my best.

961
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:15,400
- What're you getting?
- There are 2,000 notebooks here...

962
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,740
and each notebook
contains about 250 pages.

963
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,570
What about the killings?

964
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:26,180
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
what a gross stage we dance on.

965
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,380
What fun, dancing and fucking.

966
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:32,080
Not a care in the world.
Not knowing that we're nothing.

967
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:34,520
We are not what was intended."

968
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,520
Wait, there's a lot more.

969
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:41,490
"On the subway today, a man came up
to start a conversation.

970
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,030
He made small talk, a lonely man
talking about the weather and things.

971
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,260
I tried to be pleasant...

972
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:51,270
but my head began to hurt
from his banality.

973
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,500
I almost didn't notice...

974
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,940
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

975
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,450
He was not pleased...

976
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,870
and I couldn't stop laughing".

977
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,770
No dates.

978
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:06,950
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

979
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:10,020
Just his mind poured out on paper.

980
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,060
Looks like a life's work.

981
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:16,570
With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still...

982
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:19,190
- take 2 months.
- I know.

983
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,310
Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?

984
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,470
People, quiet!

985
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,170
I admire you.

986
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,600
I don't know how you found me,
but I was surprised!

987
01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:01,170
I respect you law enforcement
officers more every day.

988
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,840
Well, I appreciate that, John.

989
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,940
- I tell you--
- No, listen:

990
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:10,280
I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's setback.

991
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:15,350
I just had to call and express my
admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...

992
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:18,360
one of you, but I had
no choice, right?

993
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:23,630
You'll accept my apology? I'd like to
say more but that'd ruin the surprise.

994
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:31,870
Got it.

995
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:38,210
Everybody back to work.

996
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,810
You were right.

997
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:43,780
He's preaching.

998
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,620
These murders are his sermons to us.

999
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,560
Look, we know him. We know him.
We know him.

1000
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,160
Who's the blonde?

1001
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:02,070
Looks like a pro.

1002
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,410
Maybe.

1003
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:05,840
She caught John Doe's eye.

1004
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:10,740
Wild Bills' Leather

1005
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,080
- He came and collected it last night.
- Last night?

1006
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,850
- Yeah.
- This man?

1007
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,910
John Doe, easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1008
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:23,890
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture.

1009
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,050
One sweet piece, actually.

1010
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:28,860
I thought he was a performance artist.

1011
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,920
You know the sort of guy that...

1012
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,840
pisses in a cup on stage and then...

1013
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,340
drinks it.

1014
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,460
Performance art.

1015
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,000
Right.

1016
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,280
I think I undercharged him.

1017
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:45,540
- You made this for him?
- I've made...

1018
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:47,520
weirder shit than that.

1019
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,750
They found the blonde.

1020
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,430
The picture!

1021
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,900
The picture!

1022
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:04,000
Fucking pigs.

1023
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,870
- I need you to move.
- I'll come out, but you guys...

1024
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,270
Get the fuck out of the booth.

1025
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,540
I've been in this cage the whole time.

1026
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,280
Come on, this way.

1027
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:27,380
-Can you do something about the music?
-We're looking for the guy.

1028
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,640
You from homicide?
You better see this.

1029
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:55,640
Get this thing off me.

1030
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,750
Oh God, get it off of me.

1031
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:01,430
Get him out of here, now!

1032
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,620
I want to hear it again.

1033
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,290
Tell me again.

1034
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,930
You heard nothing strange,
saw nothing strange.

1035
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,240
He asked me if I was married.

1036
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,800
- I saw a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1037
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,140
The what? What?

1038
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,810
The prostitute. Where was she?

1039
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,380
Someone comes to your establishment...

1040
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:32,390
they want to go downstairs,
get some oo-la-la. Whatever.

1041
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,050
They got to come to you. Yeah?

1042
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:36,720
Yeah.

1043
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,130
You didn't see anyone?

1044
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,400
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1045
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:46,910
Everybody that comes in there's got
to be a package under their arms.

1046
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,500
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1047
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,570
She was just sitting on the bed.

1048
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,180
Who tied her down? You or him?

1049
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,690
Do you like what you do for a living?

1050
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,750
All these things you see?

1051
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:10,520
No, I don't.

1052
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,090
But that's life, isn't it?

1053
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,530
He had a gun. And...

1054
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:23,200
he made it happen.

1055
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,040
He made me do it.

1056
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,780
He put that thing on me.

1057
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,280
And he made me wear it.

1058
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:36,050
Then he...

1059
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,950
told me to fuck her.

1060
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:42,090
And I did. I fucked her.

1061
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,460
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1062
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:46,900
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1063
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:50,300
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1064
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:51,970
Fuck.

1065
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:56,970
Oh, God. God.

1066
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,910
God, help me.
Please, please, help me.

1067
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,260
This won't have a happy ending.

1068
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,000
- It's not possible.
- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1069
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:30,510
If we catch John Doe and he turns out
to be the devil...

1070
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,570
if he's Satan himself...

1071
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,940
that might meet our expectations.

1072
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,070
But he's not the devil.

1073
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,180
He's just a man.

1074
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,850
You know...

1075
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:46,360
You bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things.

1076
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:50,360
If you think you're preparing me
for hard time...

1077
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:51,460
thanks, but...

1078
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:54,300
But you got to be a hero.

1079
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:57,030
You want to be a champion.

1080
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,200
People don't want a champion.
They want cheeseburgers...

1081
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:03,540
- play lotto and watch TV.
- How did you get like this?

1082
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,040
I want to know.

1083
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,410
It wasn't one thing,
I'll tell you that.

1084
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,350
Go on.

1085
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:21,560
I don't think I can continue to live
in a place...

1086
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:25,400
that embraces and nurtures apathy
as if it was a virtue.

1087
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:27,460
You aren't different or better.

1088
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,230
I didn't say I was. I'm not.

1089
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:33,570
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1090
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,580
Apathy is a solution.

1091
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:42,020
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself
in drugs than it is to cope with life.

1092
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:46,020
It's easier to steal what you want
than to earn it. It's easier...

1093
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:50,680
to beat a child than to raise it.
Love costs. It takes effort, work.

1094
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,860
We talk about mentally ill people.
We are talking about fucking crazies.

1095
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:57,520
- No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1096
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,090
No, we're talking about
everyday life here.

1097
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:04,430
You can't afford to be this naive.

1098
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:06,270
Fuck off.

1099
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:07,870
See, you...

1100
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,880
You should listen to yourself.

1101
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:12,040
Yeah. You say that...

1102
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:14,600
the problem is people don't care.

1103
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:17,540
So, I don't care about people.

1104
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,450
Nonsense. You know why?

1105
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,950
You care?

1106
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:22,890
Want to know-- Damn right.

1107
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,550
You'll make a difference.

1108
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:27,120
Whatever. The point is that...

1109
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,130
you're not quitting
because you believe...

1110
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,130
these things you say.

1111
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,900
You want to believe them...

1112
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:35,400
because you're quitting.

1113
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:42,080
And you want me to agree with you and
say "You're right, it's all fucked up.

1114
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:46,310
It's a fucking mess. We should all go
live in a fucking log cabin."

1115
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,650
But I won't.

1116
01:30:49,420 --> 01:30:51,320
I won't say that.

1117
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:54,920
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1118
01:30:58,830 --> 01:30:59,660
I can't.

1119
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,600
I'm going home.

1120
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,940
Thank you, though.

1121
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,380
I love you.

1122
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,470
So much.

1123
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:04,890
I know.

1124
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:05,160
SUNDAY

1125
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,390
SUNDAY

1126
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:09,650
What's your emergency?

1127
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,320
Could you repeat that?

1128
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,230
I've done it again.

1129
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:24,830
PRIDE

1130
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,840
What have we got?

1131
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:28,900
Sleeping pills.

1132
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,840
Glued to one hand.

1133
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,410
Telephone glued to the other.

1134
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:36,380
You see what he did?

1135
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:38,880
He sliced her up.

1136
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,190
Then he bandaged her.

1137
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:43,520
Call for help and you'll live.

1138
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:45,430
But you'll be disfigured.

1139
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,920
Or put yourself out
of your own misery.

1140
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,200
Come on.

1141
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:53,700
He cut off her nose.

1142
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,530
To spite her face.

1143
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,700
And he did it very recently.

1144
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,280
Listen...

1145
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:10,280
I've decided to stay on
till this is done.

1146
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:14,220
One of two things'll happen.
Either we'll get John Doe...

1147
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:17,390
or he'll kill 7 and this case
will never end.

1148
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,800
Don't do me any favors. Thank you,
but I got it.

1149
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:25,740
I'm asking to be your partner a few
more days. You'd be doing me a favor.

1150
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,910
You knew I'd say yes. We're here.

1151
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:43,080
Your wife called.
Get an answering machine.

1152
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,090
Detective?

1153
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,420
After this I'm gone.

1154
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:53,960
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1155
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,330
You're looking for me.

1156
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,230
Don't fucking move.

1157
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:03,640
On the floor.

1158
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:05,840
- Stay back.
- On the fucking floor.

1159
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:07,110
I know you.

1160
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,510
Now. Get down.

1161
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,710
Get down on your stomach.

1162
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,220
You piece of shit. Now!

1163
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:14,650
All the way. All the way...

1164
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,210
fucker. Down.

1165
01:35:16,290 --> 01:35:17,650
Faster.

1166
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,890
Faster, fucker. Now.

1167
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,720
Nose on the ground.

1168
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,060
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1169
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:31,300
I'd like to speak
to my lawyer, please.

1170
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:34,340
Goddamn it.

1171
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:41,170
He cuts the skin off the tips of his
fingers. That's why we couldn't...

1172
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:43,410
find 1 print in his apartment.

1173
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,750
Seems he's done that for a while.

1174
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:48,410
What about the bank accounts?
The guns?

1175
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,580
So far everything is a dead end.

1176
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,420
No credit history.
No employment records.

1177
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:56,690
A 5-year old bank account
opened with cash.

1178
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:59,100
We've tried tracing his furniture.

1179
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,860
All we know about him...

1180
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:03,420
is that he's independently wealthy...

1181
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,370
well-educated...

1182
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,870
and totally insane.

1183
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,370
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1184
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:13,940
- When can we question him?
- You can't. He goes to court now.

1185
01:36:14,010 --> 01:36:18,210
There's no way he'd turn himself in.
It doesn't make any sense.

1186
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,440
There he sits.

1187
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,890
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1188
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,220
He's not finished.

1189
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:26,380
He's pissing in our faces
and we're taking it.

1190
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,050
You know what I'm saying.

1191
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:33,120
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1192
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:34,720
He wouldn't just stop.

1193
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,790
So what the fuck, man?

1194
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:40,470
He's 2 murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1195
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,410
We'll wait for his plea.

1196
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:46,950
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1197
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:51,480
My client says there're 2 more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1198
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:56,580
He will take Detectives Mills and
Somerset to these bodies, only them...

1199
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,750
and only at 6 o'clock today.

1200
01:36:58,830 --> 01:36:59,950
Why us?

1201
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,260
He says he admires you.

1202
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:05,430
It's part of the game.

1203
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:09,770
If they don't accept this offer,
these bodies will never be found.

1204
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,470
Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1205
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,270
We've got him.

1206
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,280
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1207
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:20,840
He'll get his free room and board,
cable TV.

1208
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:24,940
My wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we discussing this?

1209
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:29,350
No. Something stinks. And this one--
You. In your $3,000 suit...

1210
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,790
and that smug smile on your face.
Dealing for that piece of shit.

1211
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:35,090
I don't like it.

1212
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,100
The law requires me to serve...

1213
01:37:37,170 --> 01:37:40,690
my clients and their interests
as best I can.

1214
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:42,960
We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1215
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,530
My client informs you that...

1216
01:37:44,610 --> 01:37:47,300
if you do not accept,
he'll plead insanity.

1217
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:49,640
Let him try it.

1218
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:51,540
I'd like to see it.

1219
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:55,550
We know with the extreme nature
of these crimes I'd get him off...

1220
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,050
with such a plea.

1221
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:59,680
I won't let this conviction slide.

1222
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:03,710
If you do accept under
his specific conditions, he'll sign...

1223
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:06,560
a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1224
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,190
It's your case.
Make a decision.

1225
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,390
Full confession.

1226
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:13,660
I'm in.

1227
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,570
It must be both of you.

1228
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,170
If he were to claim insanity...

1229
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,070
this conversation is admissible.

1230
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,570
That he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1231
01:38:24,650 --> 01:38:27,670
My client wants to remind you,
2 more are dead.

1232
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:31,240
The press'd love to find out
the police weren't concerned...

1233
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,690
about finding and burying them.

1234
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,920
If in fact there are 2 more dead.

1235
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:37,650
The lab report came.

1236
01:38:37,730 --> 01:38:40,420
They did a quickie on
Doe's clothing and fingernails.

1237
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,020
They found blood from Doe's fingers,
blood from...

1238
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:47,540
the woman who's face he cut off,
and blood from...

1239
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,200
a third party...

1240
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:51,100
as yet unidentified.

1241
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:56,880
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1242
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:01,410
Let's finish it.

1243
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:08,150
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO flies out...

1244
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,560
I want you to expect it.

1245
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,720
I will.

1246
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:21,400
If I accidently shaved off a nipple,
would it be covered by workman's comp?

1247
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:27,410
I suppose so.

1248
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,910
If you were man enough
to file a claim...

1249
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,780
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1250
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:39,020
I keep coming home late,
my wife'll think something's up.

1251
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,090
You know...

1252
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:51,590
Yeah.

1253
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:58,660
What?

1254
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:10,580
Will this wind hurt us?

1255
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,090
Who are you, John?

1256
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:03,470
Who are you really?

1257
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:05,470
What do you mean?

1258
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:09,440
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us about yourself?

1259
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:13,140
Doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1260
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,040
Stay on your left up here.

1261
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:20,250
Where are we heading?

1262
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:22,710
You'll see.

1263
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:26,590
We're not just going to pick up
2 more bodies, are we?

1264
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:29,490
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1265
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,330
You've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1266
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:36,000
Wanting people to listen...

1267
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:37,330
you can't just...

1268
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,840
tap them on the shoulder anymore.

1269
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:42,400
You have to use a sledgehammer.

1270
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:45,410
Then you'll get
their strict attention.

1271
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,070
But the question is:

1272
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:50,340
Why're you so special
that people should listen?

1273
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:51,910
I'm not special.

1274
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,010
I've never been exceptional.

1275
01:42:55,650 --> 01:42:58,420
This is, though. What I'm doing.

1276
01:42:58,490 --> 01:42:59,650
My work.

1277
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,390
Your work, John?

1278
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:02,650
Yes.

1279
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:06,150
See, I don't see anything special
about it, John.

1280
01:43:07,330 --> 01:43:08,730
That's not true.

1281
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,600
No, it is true. And the funny
thing is, all this work...

1282
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,500
in 2 months, no one'll care,
or give a shit, or even remember.

1283
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:20,600
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1284
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:23,380
But when this is done...

1285
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:26,080
when it's finished...

1286
01:43:27,690 --> 01:43:29,420
it's going to be...

1287
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:35,230
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1288
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:37,960
But they won't be able to deny.

1289
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:41,060
Could the freak be more vague?

1290
01:43:42,030 --> 01:43:43,700
As far as master plans go...

1291
01:43:44,370 --> 01:43:46,630
I really can't wait for you to see.

1292
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:48,470
It's going to be something.

1293
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,310
Know what?
I'll be standing next to you.

1294
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,640
So when this thing happens,
be sure and let me know.

1295
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,180
Don't want to miss it.

1296
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,910
Oh, don't worry.

1297
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:00,580
You won't.

1298
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:04,420
You won't miss a thing.

1299
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:32,670
What's so exciting?

1300
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,880
It's not too far now.

1301
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:47,620
I've tried to figure something in my
head. Maybe you can help me out.

1302
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,340
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are, do you know...

1303
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:55,300
that you're insane?

1304
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,940
Maybe you're reading...

1305
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,140
masturbating in your own feces...

1306
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,210
Do you just stop and go:

1307
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:05,880
"Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1308
01:45:05,950 --> 01:45:08,650
You know? Do you guys do that?

1309
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:12,050
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1310
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:13,390
It's very comfortable.

1311
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:17,220
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1312
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:20,830
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1313
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,060
Whatever.

1314
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:24,400
I don't doubt that you believe that.

1315
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,160
but it seems that you're...

1316
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,330
overlooking a contradiction.

1317
01:45:29,410 --> 01:45:30,810
Meaning what?

1318
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:33,400
Glad you asked.

1319
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:36,850
If you were chosen...

1320
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,350
that is, by a higher...

1321
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:41,350
power...

1322
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,510
and if your hand was forced...

1323
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,260
it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment.

1324
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:50,190
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1325
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:54,430
That doesn't seem to fit
with martyrdom, does it?

1326
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,100
John?

1327
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:06,780
I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.
Mills would enjoy time alone with me...

1328
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:08,540
in a room without windows.

1329
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:10,780
Isn't that true?

1330
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:12,790
How'd you like to...

1331
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:15,880
- hurt me with impunity?
- That hurts my feelings.

1332
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:17,720
I would never.

1333
01:46:17,790 --> 01:46:20,560
You wouldn't only because
there's consequences.

1334
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:24,720
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1335
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,460
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1336
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,900
I won't deny my own personal desire...

1337
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:33,130
to turn each sin against
the sinner.

1338
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:37,410
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1339
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:42,080
Innocent? ls that supposed
to be funny?

1340
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:44,480
An obese man.

1341
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:47,080
Disgusting man who could barely stand.

1342
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:51,650
You'd point him out to your friends
so that they'd join you in mocking him.

1343
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:56,160
If you saw him while you ate,
you couldn't finish your meal.

1344
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:00,460
Then the lawyer. You had to
secretly thank me for that.

1345
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,930
This is a man who dedicated
his life...

1346
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:08,770
to making money by lying with every
breath he could muster to keep...

1347
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,780
murderers and rapists...

1348
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:12,510
- on the streets.
- Murderers?

1349
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:15,650
- Murderers, like yourself?
- A woman...

1350
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,620
so ugly inside that she
couldn't go on living...

1351
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:21,020
if she couldn't be beautiful outside?

1352
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:25,460
A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.
Let's not forget...

1353
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:28,330
the disease-spreading whore.

1354
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:33,030
Only in a world this shitty...

1355
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,940
could you say they were innocent
and keep a straight face.

1356
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:41,640
But that's the point.

1357
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:46,210
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1358
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:47,810
in every home and we...

1359
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:49,220
tolerate it.

1360
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:52,550
We tolerate it because it's common.

1361
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:54,050
It's trivial.

1362
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:57,220
We tolerate it morning,
noon and night.

1363
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:02,320
Well, not anymore.

1364
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,670
I'm setting the example.

1365
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,000
And what I've done will be...

1366
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:11,400
puzzled over...

1367
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:13,400
and studied...

1368
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:16,010
and followed...

1369
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:19,010
forever.

1370
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:21,010
Yeah.

1371
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:23,480
Delusions of grandeur.

1372
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:27,350
You should be thanking me.

1373
01:48:27,820 --> 01:48:29,190
Why's that, John?

1374
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:32,420
Because you'll be remembered
after this.

1375
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:36,430
Realize, Detective, the only reason
that I'm here now...

1376
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,590
is that I wanted to be.

1377
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:41,360
No. We would have got you eventually.

1378
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,870
Oh, really?

1379
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:47,170
So what were you doing,
biding your time? Toying with me?

1380
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:50,770
Allowing 5 "innocent" people
to die until...

1381
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:53,280
you felt like springing your trap?

1382
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:55,280
What was the indisputable...

1383
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:58,380
evidence you were going to use on me,
right before...

1384
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,120
I walked up to you and put my hands
in the air?

1385
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:04,390
John. Calm down.

1386
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,950
I remember us knocking on your door.

1387
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,230
That's right.

1388
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,630
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1389
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,700
You're only alive
because I didn't kill you.

1390
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:21,470
Okay. Sit back.

1391
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,570
- I spared you.
- Sit back.

1392
01:49:23,650 --> 01:49:26,140
Remember that when you
look in the mirror...

1393
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,410
for the rest of your life...

1394
01:49:28,490 --> 01:49:31,980
or should I say for the rest
of what life I allow you...

1395
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:33,420
to have.

1396
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,430
Sit back, you fucking freak!

1397
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:37,050
Shut your fucking mouth!

1398
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:43,000
You're no messiah. You're a movie
of the week. A fucking tee-shirt...

1399
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,920
at best.

1400
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:00,510
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:04,950
I don't mourn them any more than the
1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.

1402
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:09,620
Is that to say, John, that what
you were doing was God's good work?

1403
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:15,630
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1404
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:20,300
Do you see those high tension towers?

1405
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:22,200
That's where we're headed.

1406
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:24,870
I see it. 9 o'clock,
and follow that road.

1407
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:41,890
There sure as shit is no ambush
out here.

1408
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:44,050
No fucking nothing out here.

1409
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:48,060
They'll come up behind us in about
2 minutes.

1410
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:50,230
I want you to go way up.

1411
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:53,670
In thirty seconds, bank east
on my mark. Thirty seconds.

1412
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:56,570
I'll get him.

1413
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,640
Get out.

1414
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,810
Slowly.

1415
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:08,740
Stop.

1416
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:10,810
Stay.

1417
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:15,250
What do you got?

1418
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:18,080
A dead dog.

1419
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:21,550
I didn't do that.

1420
01:52:28,230 --> 01:52:29,430
What time is it?

1421
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,100
Why?

1422
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,900
I'd like to know.

1423
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:37,330
7:01.

1424
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:41,740
It's close.

1425
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,940
Let's go take a look.

1426
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:48,780
It's this way.

1427
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,500
Down. Down. Down.

1428
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:42,400
Watch him.

1429
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:45,040
There he goes.

1430
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,310
It's good we have
some time to talk.

1431
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:57,390
The guy in red.
Keep the crosshairs on him.

1432
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,520
A van's coming down the road.

1433
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:08,030
From the north.

1434
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:21,370
Be ready for anything.
Wait for my signal. Wait for me.

1435
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:28,210
Get out!

1436
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:31,880
Out!

1437
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:34,120
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.

1438
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,460
Step away.

1439
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,190
Turn around. Hands on your head.

1440
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:40,030
What's going on?

1441
01:54:40,970 --> 01:54:42,130
Why are you here?

1442
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:46,140
I'm delivering a package
for this guy, David.

1443
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:47,570
Detective...

1444
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:48,900
David Mills.

1445
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:57,980
Get it. Slowly.

1446
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:13,330
A guy paid me $500
to bring it out here.

1447
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,600
He wanted it here at exactly
7 o'clock.

1448
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:17,430
Put it down.

1449
01:55:18,570 --> 01:55:19,940
We got a box.

1450
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:22,600
We got a box.
Call the bomb squad.

1451
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,310
Bomb squad. We got a box.

1452
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,940
Face the van.

1453
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:27,840
Hands up.

1454
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:36,460
Turn.

1455
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,460
Okay. Go.

1456
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:41,020
Off you go. Go.

1457
01:55:43,230 --> 01:55:45,330
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1458
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:50,400
He's headed north, along the road.

1459
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:51,730
Have him picked up.

1460
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:03,010
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

1461
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:11,080
I'm going to open it.

1462
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,360
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1463
01:56:33,820 --> 01:56:34,870
It's blood.

1464
01:56:34,950 --> 01:56:37,550
You've made quite a life for yourself,
Detective.

1465
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:41,220
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1466
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:10,410
California, stay away from here.

1467
01:57:10,490 --> 01:57:13,080
Stay away from here, now.
Don't, don't, don't come in here.

1468
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:15,220
Whatever you hear, stay away.

1469
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:18,250
John Doe has the upper hand.

1470
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:21,160
Here he comes.

1471
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:23,160
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1472
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:25,430
- I wish I could have lived like you.
- Shut up.

1473
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,700
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1474
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:30,070
Do you hear me, Detective?

1475
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,800
I'm trying to tell you how much...

1476
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:34,370
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1477
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:36,470
What?

1478
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:37,740
Tracy.

1479
01:57:38,650 --> 01:57:41,240
- What'd you fucking say?
- It's disturbing...

1480
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:44,250
how easily a member of the press
can purchase...

1481
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,260
information from the men
in your precinct.

1482
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,150
What the fuck?

1483
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:50,420
Throw your gun down!

1484
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:52,490
I visited your home this morning...

1485
01:57:53,330 --> 01:57:54,990
after you left.

1486
01:57:55,830 --> 01:57:57,630
I tried to play husband.

1487
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,760
I tried to taste the life
of a simple man.

1488
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,100
Throw it away!

1489
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:05,330
It didn't work out.

1490
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,170
So...

1491
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,180
I took a souvenir.

1492
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:12,750
Her pretty head.

1493
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,110
- What's, what's he talking about?
- Give me the gun.

1494
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:21,450
What's goin' on over there?

1495
01:58:21,530 --> 01:58:23,550
Would you... Put the gun down.

1496
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:25,030
I saw you with the box.
What was in the box?

1497
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:26,960
Because I envy your normal life.

1498
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:28,190
Put the gun down, David.

1499
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:30,130
It seems that envy is my sin.

1500
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,130
- What's in the box?
- Not until you give me the gun.

1501
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,640
What's in the fucking box?

1502
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,700
He just told you.

1503
01:58:35,770 --> 01:58:38,940
You lie! You're a fucking liar!
Shut up!

1504
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,440
That's what he wants. He wan--
He wants you to shoot him.

1505
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:47,950
No! No. You tell me.
You tell me that's not true.

1506
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:50,210
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1507
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:51,550
She's all right. You tell me.

1508
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:52,820
Become...

1509
01:58:52,890 --> 01:58:53,980
wrath.

1510
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:55,220
Tell me she's all right!

1511
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:57,320
If you murder a suspect, David...

1512
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,720
you just throw it all away
and he knows it.

1513
01:59:01,370 --> 01:59:03,490
- She begged for her life, Detective.
- Shut up!

1514
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:05,830
She begged for her life...

1515
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,900
and for the life of the baby
inside of her.

1516
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:27,760
He didn't know.

1517
01:59:41,610 --> 01:59:43,270
Give me the gun, David.

1518
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,870
If you kill him...

1519
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:55,720
he will win.

1520
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:01,890
Oh God!

1521
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:03,390
Oh God!

1522
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:14,460
Well, we'll take care of him.

1523
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:25,470
Whatever he needs.

1524
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:28,170
Where you gonna be?

1525
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,150
Around.

1526
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:38,060
I'll be around.

1527
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,730
Ernest Hemingway once wrote:

1528
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,500
The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."

1529
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:52,160
I agree with the second part.
